<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Hi there, this is my personal portfolio web application built in React. Started writing this portfolio project in HTML, CSS and a few JavaScript functions. Converted to a React app soon after, using React Components for most of the objects in the app. 

Email form is done with a custom FormComponent class, validating the email through an await fetch api request, if the email address entered has a valid SMTP connection, EmailJS is used to send the message to my email. 

Navbar slider animation is done on scroll, checks if an element is in view of the client, then using translateY, moves the slider appropriately. 

Using CSS Grid for most of the site.
